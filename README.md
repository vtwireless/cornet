## Description

Particular Scripts for the Cognitive Radio Network Testbed (CORNET).

A software project to aid in installing software on the CORNET SDR
(software defined radio) test system at Virginia Tech.  It contains
scripts and configuration files that are particular to that system.  This
is only intended to be useful to that system, though files from this
project could be harvested and used by others.  Files that become generic
will likely be moved to the CRTS (Cognitive Radio Test System) software
project, https://github.com/vtwireless/crts .

## Installing

Configure by copying Install/default_config.bash to Install/config.bash
and than edit Install/config.bash .  Or you can skip that step and you
will use the default configuration from Install/default_config.bash.

Then run "sudo ./Install/Install".
