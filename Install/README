The Install script needs to be run as root.

Install runs the scripts stage*.bash in the order that the script
filenames sort.  So that why the stage scripts have names that have
numbers in them.  So

   stage03.user.bash will run as the user that owns
   ../README.md before running stage05.root.bash as
   user root.

You can add more stages to this install script by adding files with
filenames like stage*.user.bash or stage*.root.bash.

File like *.done and *.FAILED are generated files that let you have
a little feedback and control as to what ran and what will run
respectively.

All the stage* scripts are run with variables from the configuration
file config.bash and are run with the current working directory being
this directory.
