# DEFAULT_SERVER_ADDRESS is the address or domain name that refers to this
# server from computers (nodes) that access the stream programs that
# access the USRPs. This address will be used to let the CRTS spectrum
# feed program and the CRTS Controllers connect to this server.  You want
# this to be the IP4 address of the computer that you are running the web
# server on.   For example DEFAULT_SERVER_ADDRESS=192.168.40.141
#
# This is not necessarily an address that is accessible from the Internet.
#
# Since we get the address from a program there may be no need to change
# this.

# Clearly this will fail unless ifconfig is installed.
